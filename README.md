# Traits
Being new to this field, with zero bacground,  I know I have to put in triple work to 
learn and understand every checkpoint. One positive trait I have is I use my 
*frustrations* positively. It makes me do better and work harder to meet my goals. 
This whole course is a big challenge. Everything that I've been 
reading so far is very new to me. I have a notebook right next to me and I am 
jotting down all the questions I have for my mentor. 
One of the keys that will need managing on my part, I will say is **TIME**. 
Being a wife, a mom , a full time employee and a student I need to be able to manage my time wisely. 
My goal is not only to understand but also to be able to finish this course on time.
